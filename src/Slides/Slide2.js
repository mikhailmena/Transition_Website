            <h2 style={{color: 'red' }}>Stop Asking your buddies if you should get out</h2>
            <p>Instead, ask someone who found success outside of
                the Military about their experience. 9 times out of 10,
                they're going to tell you they're happy they got out.
            </p>
            <h2 style={{color: 'red' }}>Stop waiting to start SFL TAP</h2>
            <p>
            You need to start SFL TAP now! By law, you are
            authorized to start SFL TAP  as early as 18 months before your the
            end of your contract. By starting now, you will get
            introduced to so many resources and people who will help
            you with your transition process.
            <h2 style={{color: 'red' }}>Stop trying to tough it out</h2>
            I had a lot of medical issues that I refused to get help with
            because I thought I was being tough. That was STUPID.
            You probably have some aches, pains, problems sleeping,
            anger, anxiety, knee problems, feet problems, back
            problems etc.. Go to the freaking medic today and get
            seen. You earned this healthcare and you will need the
            evidence for your VA claim.
            </p>
            <h2 style={{color: 'red' }}>Stop saying "I'll figure it out later"</h2>
            <p>Figuring out what to do when I was leaving the Army was
                one of the hardest decisions to make. A counselor asked
                me if I had 6 months to plan a mission, range, training, or
                deployment, would I be stressed about it? No. That's
                plenty of time. So start planning your next move now so
                that you will have time to pick a career that makes you
                happy when you get out.</p>
