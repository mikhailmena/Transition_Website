            <p style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}} >My name is Marc and I want to help you
            transition out of the Military without as feeling
            overwhelmed and frustrated. I am a former
            Active Duty Staff Sergeant who served 8 years in
            the Army. During my service, I was a "hard
            charger", "high speed", "highly motivated" NCO
            and I gave everything I had to making my
            Soldiers' lives better. When I started the
            transition process, I was not expecting it to be so
            confusing, frustrating, and complicated. I made
            this guide to help you get out of the Military with
            less stress and more success.</p>
            <p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>If you are feeling a little uncertain about getting
            out, here's my advice:</p>
            
            <h3 style={{color: 'green'}}>DO IT!!</h3>
            <p style={{color: 'blue'}} >
            There is a reason why you considered getting out
            and most of us get caught in the trap of staying
            in the Military because it seems easier to deal
            with the problems we know instead of dealing
            with new problems.
