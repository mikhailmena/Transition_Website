            <h3>Program Description</h3>
            <p>
            You can participate in a Career Skills Program/DOD
            Skillbridge where for the last six months of your contract,
            you will report to a company to work for them while still
            getting paid from the military. There is a new program
            called VET TEC which will pay for you to attend a coding
            bootcamp, cybersecurity bootcamp, or other technical
            school so you can break into Tech for free. You can use this
            before or after your get out. If you use this after you
            separate from the military, you will get paid BAH for E5 for
            the location of the program. I did a 6 month virtual coding
            bootcamp from my house. I was still getting paid by the
            Military and kept all of my benefits.
