            <h1 style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}> THANK YOU</h1>
            
            <p> <span style={{fontSize: '24px', color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bolder'}}> Thank you </span> for taking the time to read through this
                guide and take a small step toward having a
                successful transition out of the Military. This has
                not been comprehensive and there are so many
                resources available to you I did not include. I hope
                that this comes to you as <span style={{fontSize: '24px', color: 'green'}}> encouragement that
                you are not alone </span>  and that at the end of this
                event in your life, you are going to be <span style={{fontSize: '24px', color: 'blue'}}> better </span> than
                you may have thought you would be. Transitioning
                is such a <span style={{fontSize: '24px', color: 'blue'}}> huge decision </span> and it caused me a lot of
                anxiety and stress. What helped me the most was
                reaching out to counselors who were <span style={{fontSize: '24px', color: 'green'}}> patient with 
                me</span> and helped me come to my decision to get out.
                I really hope that you connect with some people
                who really <span style={{fontSize: '24px', color: 'blue'}}> care about your wellbeing </span>  and who
                are in a position to support you and offer you
                helpful advice or just to let you rant. If you would
                like more resources or to talk about your transition,
                feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-m-menard/">LinkedIn</a>. I am not a
                licensed professional or anything like that, I would
                just like to help.
            </p>
