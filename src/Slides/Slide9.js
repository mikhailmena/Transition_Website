            <h1 style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}> Becoming a Civilian</h1>
            
            <p> For a long time, we were told that we are our
                <span style={{color: 'purple'}}> Branch, Rank, or Position</span> in the Military. The
                truth is that you are a <span style={{color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold'}}> person </span> who filled those
                roles while you were in the Service but your
                identity has always been separate from the
                Military. I was <span style={{color: 'red'}}> afraid </span> that when I got out, I would
                be telling people to do Push ups, knife handing
                my supervisor, and calling everyone "Sir" or
                "Ma'am. Yes, you will have to work hard to act like
                a regular person,but <span style={{color: 'blue'}} > be patient with yourself </span> 
                and realize every other single person who got out
                of the Military went through a similar process and
                they made it just fine.
            </p>
            <p>I was civilian for 12 years after High School before
                I joined the Military and it has changed so much
                about how I <span style={{color: 'purple'}}> approach situations, process my
                emotions, and deal with problems. </span> Ultimately,
                I am still the <span style={{color: 'green'}}>same person</span> , I just have some
                added skills and tools to make me successful as
                I leave the Service. I want you to know, that this
                process will be challenging but <span style={{color: 'green'}}> it is not even
                close to the hardest thing </span>  that you have been
                through in your life this far.</p>
