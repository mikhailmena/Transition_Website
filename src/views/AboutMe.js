            <Card.Text>
              My name is Marc Menard and I am a 36 Year old father, husband, and Veteran. I was raised by loving parents and my Father served
              20 years in the Navy. I have two sisters, a 3 year old son, and have been married for 12 years.
              <br></br>
              I spent 8 years in the Army as an Apache Helicopter Avionics Electronics Armament System Repairer. Four of the years were served as an Non-Commissioned Officer. 
              During my time in the Army, I had wide range of experiences; both good and bad. The best parts of the my experience were the times when I made a positive impact on the lives of the people around me.
              I am grateful for my time and look forward to my future in the civilian sector.
              <br></br> 
              I left the Army to pursue my dream of being a Software Developer. I enjoy making things with my hands and Software Development 
              gives me that opportunity while being able to help people through technology.
